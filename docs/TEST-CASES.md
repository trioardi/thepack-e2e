# DayBook — Test Case Documentation & Testing Strategy

**Application under test:** DayBook — a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) personal journaling app
**Author:** Eric · **Date:** 2026-07-09
**Deliverables:** Playwright E2E suite · Jest + Supertest API suite · Bug report · This document

## 1. Testing strategy

### 1.1 Objective
Validate the two core user journeys the brief calls out — **Authentication** (signup, login, logout, update details,
change password, edge cases) and **Journal Entry CRUD + Search** — across both layers of the stack, and surface any
correctness/UX defects with reproducible evidence.

### 1.2 Test pyramid & tool choice
Each concern is tested at the layer where it is cheapest and most reliable:

| Layer | Tool | What it covers | Why |
|-------|------|----------------|-----|
| **API / integration** | Jest + Supertest | Every REST endpoint, all status codes, validation rules, ownership/isolation | Fast, deterministic, exhaustive on edge cases without UI flakiness |
| **E2E / UI** | Playwright (TypeScript) | Real user journeys through the React UI against the live API | Confirms the wiring the user actually experiences |
| **Exploratory** | Manual smoke + API probing | UI/UX inconsistencies, invalid input, crash cases | Finds what scripted tests assume away |

### 1.3 Design principles applied
- **Test isolation** — every test provisions its own uniquely-named user/entry (timestamp + process id + random), so
  the suite runs fully in parallel against a shared database with no cross-test coupling.
- **Arrange via API, assert via UI** — E2E specs seed prerequisite state through the API for speed, then drive and
  assert the behaviour under test through the UI.
- **Meaningful assertions** — specs verify specific content (the created entry's title/mood/content, the exact error
  message, that the *new* password works and the *old* one is rejected) — not just navigation.
- **Positive + negative coverage** — each feature has happy-path and edge-case cases.
- **Executable bug documentation** — confirmed backend defects are encoded as `test.failing` cases so the suite stays
  green today but automatically flags the day each bug is fixed (see §5).

### 1.4 Scope
**In scope:** all documented REST endpoints; signup/login/logout/profile/password UI flows; entry create/read/update/
delete/search UI flows; input validation; auth/ownership boundaries.
**Out of scope:** load/performance, security pen-testing, cross-browser matrix (Chromium-first, browser-agnostic code),
visual regression, email delivery (app has none).

### 1.5 Test environment
| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Frontend | React + Vite @ `http://localhost:5173` |
| Backend | Node/Express @ `http://localhost:3000` |
| Database | MongoDB (local / in-memory) |
| Runner | Playwright 1.60 (Chromium), Jest 29 + Supertest 7, Node 18+ |

## 4. API test cases (Jest + Supertest)

Location: [`api/tests`](../api/tests) · Run: `npm run test:api`
Each row is one test case: the **Request** column is the step, the **Expected result** column is the assertion.

### 4.1 Authentication — `auth.api.test.ts`
| # | Request (step) | Expected result |
|---|----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | `POST /auth/signup` with valid data | **201**; profile returned (email/first/last), no password echoed; auth cookie set |
| 2 | `POST /auth/signup` with an existing email | **422** "User already exist!" |
| 3 | `POST /auth/signup` missing password | **400** "Fill all required fields!" |
| 4 | `POST /auth/signup` with `not-an-email` | **422** "Invalid email format!" |
| 5 | `POST /auth/signup` with password `weak` | **422** "Please enter strong password!" |
| 6 | `POST /auth/login` with valid creds | **200** "User logged in successfully!"; cookie set |
| 7 | `POST /auth/login` with wrong password | **401** "Invalid credentials!" |
| 8 | `POST /auth/login` unknown user | **401** "Invalid credentials!" |
| 9 | `POST /auth/logout` | **200** "Logout successfully!" |
| 10 | `PUT /auth/change-password` valid old+new | **200**; new password logs in, old password → 401 |
| 11 | `PUT /auth/change-password` no auth cookie | **401** |
| 12 | `PUT /auth/change-password` only old provided | **400** "Both old and new passwords are required!" |
| 13 | `PUT /auth/change-password` wrong old | **401** "Old Password is incorrect!" |
| 14 | `PUT /auth/change-password` new == old | **422** "New password must differ!" |
| 15 | `PUT /auth/change-password` weak new | **422** "Please enter strong password!" |

### 4.2 User profile — `users.api.test.ts`
| # | Request (step) | Expected result |
|---|----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | `GET /users/me` authenticated | **200**; correct email/first/last |
| 2 | `GET /users/me` no cookie | **401** "No token found! Please log in and try again!" |
| 3 | `PUT /users/me` with first+last | **200**; re-fetch confirms persistence |
| 4 | `PUT /users/me` empty firstName | **422** "First name is required!" |

| 3 | `POST /entries` `date: not-a-date` | **422** "Please provide a valid date!" |
| 4 | `POST /entries` title > 20 chars | **422** "Title length should not be more than 20 characters!" |
| 5 | `POST /entries` content > 1500 chars | **422** |
| 6 | `POST /entries` no cookie | **401** |
| 7 | `GET /entries` | **200**; array includes the created entry |
| 8 | `GET /entries/:id` valid | **200**; correct document |
| 9 | `GET /entries/:id` non-existent (well-formed id) | **404** |
| 10 | `GET /entries/:id` for another user's entry | **404** (ownership isolation) |
| 11 | `PATCH /entries/:id` valid | **200**; fields updated |

| 18 | `GET /entries/search?text=<101 chars>` | **422** |

**API total: 43 tests passing + 1 skipped** (the destructive crash case, BUG-01).

## 5. Known-defect tests (executable bug documentation)

Location: [`api/tests/known-issues.api.test.ts`](../api/tests/known-issues.api.test.ts).

Confirmed backend defects are encoded as Jest **`test.failing`** cases that assert the *correct* expected behaviour.
Because the app is currently buggy, these are reported **green** (the assertion is expected to fail). If a developer
fixes the bug, the corresponding `test.failing` starts failing loudly — a built-in regression alarm. **BUG-01** is
`test.skip` because running it crashes the shared server; its full repro lives in the test file and the bug report.

| Test | Maps to | Current behaviour | Correct behaviour |
|------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| signup without email | BUG-02 | 500 | 400 |
| login empty body | BUG-03 | 500 | 400 |
| get entry malformed id | BUG-04 | 500 | 4xx |
| search regex metachar `(` | BUG-05 | 500 | < 500 |
| create entry invalid mood | BUG-06 | 500 | 422 |
| update profile w/o lastName | BUG-01 | **process crash** | ≤ 4xx (skipped) |

Full analysis, severity and fixes: [`docs/BUG-REPORT.md`](./BUG-REPORT.md).

## 6. Results summary

| Suite | Tests | Result |
|-------|-------|--------|
| API (Jest + Supertest) | 44 (43 pass, 1 skip) | ✅ Green |
| E2E (Playwright) | 13 | ✅ Green (stable at 4 parallel workers) |
| Confirmed defects | 10 filed | 1 Critical, 1 High, 5 Medium, 3 Low |

### Headline finding
**BUG-01 (Critical):** `PUT /api/users/me` for any account without a last name throws an unhandled `TypeError` outside
the try/catch and **crashes the entire Node process** — a one-request denial of service reachable from the normal
Profile → Save UI flow. This should be fixed first.
